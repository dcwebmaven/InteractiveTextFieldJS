# InteractiveTextFieldJS
This JavaScript project presents an interactive text field that allows users to input their name but only shows the page to people named Scott (case insensitive).

The objective/specs for this project were as follows:

Create a webpage with a text field and a button. The page should instruct the user to enter his or her name. If this name is equal to scott or Scott, welcome the user to the page. If the name equals something else, inform the user that they are unauthorized to view the page.
